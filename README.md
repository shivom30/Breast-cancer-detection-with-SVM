Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and improving survival rates. This project aims to build a machine learning model using SVM to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on various features.

Dataset
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is used in this project. It consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The dataset includes the following features:

Mean of each feature (e.g., mean radius, mean texture)
Standard error of each feature
Worst or largest value for each feature
The target variable indicates whether the tumor is benign (0) or malignant (1).

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
